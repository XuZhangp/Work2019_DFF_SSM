1. Introduction
In this work, we propose a deep feature fusion model and integrate it into the most 
popular deep learning architecture for sentence matching task. The integrated 
architecture mainly consists of embedding layer, deep feature fusion layer, matching
layer and prediction layer. In addition, we also comparethe commonly used loss function,
and propose a novel hybrid loss function integratingMSE and cross entropy together, 
considering confidence interval and threshold settingto preserve the indistinguishable
instances in training process. To evaluate our model performance, we experiment on 
two real world public data sets: LCQMC and Quora. The experiment results demonstrate 
that our model outperforms the most existing advanceddeep learning models for sentence 
matching, benefited from our enhanced loss function and deep feature fusion model 
for capturing semantic context.
